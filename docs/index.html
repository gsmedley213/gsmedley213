  <h2>Losses on Declining Markets</h2>
  <p class="drop-cap" annotation-id="79">THAT the <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>packing industry<span class="explanation" annotation-element>The factories that prepare meat to be sold in stores.</span></span> suffers with the <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>livestock producers<span class="explanation" annotation-element>The farmers who raise animals like cows and pigs.</span></span> on a <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>falling market<span class="explanation" annotation-element>When the price of things is going down.</span></span> was never more clearly <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>emphasized<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Showed how important something is.</span></span> than in the year 1919. Armour and Company’s losses on <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>dressed beef<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Beef that has been prepared and is ready to be sold.</span></span> alone <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>amounted<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Added up to.</span></span>, in the twelve months, to several million dollars; and on the sale of <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>pork products<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Food made from pigs, like bacon or ham.</span></span> the losses were even greater.</p>
  <p annotation-id="80">These losses are figured on the basis of the <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>primary<span class="explanation" annotation-element>The first or main sales.</span></span> sales, which include not only the meat but the hides and all other <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>by-products<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Extra things that are made when you make the main thing you want. Like if you're baking a cake, the extra batter you lick off the spoon is like a by-product.</span></span> <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>derived<span class="explanation" annotation-element>To get something from something else.</span></span> from the animals.</p>
  <p annotation-id="81">Such <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>Deficits<span class="explanation" annotation-element>When a business spends more money than it makes, that's a deficit. It's like owing money instead of having it.</span></span> do not mean that the Armour <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>Organization<span class="explanation" annotation-element>A group of people working together, like a club or a company.</span></span>, as a whole, suffered a <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>Net loss<span class="explanation" annotation-element>If a company has a 'net loss' it means that when you subtract all the money they spent from all the money they earned, the final number is a loss.</span></span> for the year. But there is no mystery about the methods of <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>Countering<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Doing something to stop or fix a problem.</span></span> these <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>Deficits<span class="explanation" annotation-element>When a business spends more money than it makes, that's a deficit. It's like owing money instead of having it.</span></span>. They are <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>Offset<span class="explanation" annotation-element>To balance or make up for something else. Like if you broke a vase, doing extra chores could offset the problem.</span></span> by the profit made in <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>Manufacturing<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Making things, usually in a factory.</span></span> <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>By-products<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Things that are made as a result of making something else. Like when you make juice, the leftover pulp is a by-product.</span></span> into <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>Merchantable<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Something that is good enough to be sold.</span></span> <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>Commodities<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Things that can be bought or sold, like food, metal, or oil.</span></span>. Each by-product industry in the Armour <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>Organization<span class="explanation" annotation-element>A group of people working together, like a club or a company.</span></span> is placed on its own responsibility. It must pay to the beef, hog, or sheep killing department the market value for its <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>Raw materials<span class="explanation" annotation-element>The basic stuff that is used to make something else. Like flour is a raw material for bread.</span></span>—the same price it would pay if it purchased on the outside market.</p>
  <p annotation-id="82">For example, the beef department buys its cattle to the best possible advantage in competition with other buyers, and sells the beef at the best price <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>obtainable<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Able to get</span></span>. The hides go to the <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>tannery<span class="explanation" annotation-element>A place where animal skins are turned into leather.</span></span> at prices <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>ruling<span class="explanation" annotation-element>What is normal at this time</span></span> on the open <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>market<span class="explanation" annotation-element>A place where things are bought and sold.</span></span>. If the Armour <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>tannery<span class="explanation" annotation-element>A place where animal skins are turned into leather.</span></span> cannot pay this price the hides go to outside buyers. To sell at less would be favoring the <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>tannery<span class="explanation" annotation-element>A place where animal skins are turned into leather.</span></span> at the expense of the beef department, or robbing Peter to pay Paul.</p>
  <p annotation-id="83">The same business methods are <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>pursued<span class="explanation" annotation-element>To try to do something or follow a plan.</span></span> with every <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>scrap<span class="explanation" annotation-element>A small piece or leftover of something.</span></span> of the animal, whether used in making glue, soap, sand-paper, drugs, <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>fertilizers<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Stuff added to the soil to help plants grow.</span></span>, or any other <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>commodity<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Something that can be bought or sold.</span></span>.</p>
  <p annotation-id="84">While on this basis Armour and Company <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>sustained<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Like when you hold something up for a long time, but in this case, it means they had losses for a long time.</span></span> <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>heavy losses<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Lost a lot of money.</span></span> in their <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>meat departments<span class="explanation" annotation-element>The part of the company that deals with selling meat.</span></span>, the <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>by-product industries<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Industries that make things from the parts of the animal that aren't meat, like leather or glue.</span></span> showed <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>profits<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Money that the company makes after paying all its bills.</span></span>, as they usually do, because their products are not so <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>perishable<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Something that goes bad quickly, like meat.</span></span> and are not so much influenced by <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>market fluctuations<span class="explanation" annotation-element>When the price of things goes up and down.</span></span>.</p>
  <p annotation-id="85">These <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>By-product industries<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Businesses that make things from leftover parts of animals. Like using bones to make glue.</span></span> are, in short, the <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>Insurance<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Something that protects you from losing a lot of money.

  <h2>Why Prices Fluctuate</h2>
  <p class="drop-cap" annotation-id="86">PRICES for <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>livestock<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Animals like cows and pigs that are raised on farms.</span></span> are not controlled by <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>packers<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Companies that prepare meat for people to buy, like cutting it up and putting it in packages.</span></span>, and only to a limited extent by the <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>supply<span class="explanation" annotation-element>How much of something is available.</span></span> of <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>cattle<span class="explanation" annotation-element>A group of cows.</span></span> in the <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>market<span class="explanation" annotation-element>A place where people buy and sell things.</span></span>. They go up or down in response to the price the <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>consumer<span class="explanation" annotation-element>A person who buys things.</span></span> is willing to pay for meat.</p>
  <p annotation-id="87">Note how closely the two lines in the chart, representing prices of cattle and <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>dressed beef<span class="explanation" annotation-element>That means beef that's ready to be sold in stores, all cut up and prepared from the cow.</span></span>, follow each other through the two and a half years covered by the graph. America’s twenty million food shoppers determine the <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>dressed beef<span class="explanation" annotation-element>That means beef that's ready to be sold in stores, all cut up and prepared from the cow.</span></span> price, by their willingness or refusal to accept beef at the price asked in <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>competition<span class="explanation" annotation-element>When different sellers try to get people to buy their stuff by offering better prices or better things.</span></span> with other food. And naturally <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>dressed beef<span class="explanation" annotation-element>That means beef that's ready to be sold in stores, all cut up and prepared from the cow.</span></span> prices <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>react<span class="explanation" annotation-element>To do something in response to something else</span></span> <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>directly<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Right away and without anything else changing it.</span></span> and at once on cattle prices.</p>
  <p annotation-id="88">It is often necessary for the <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>packer<span class="explanation" annotation-element>A company that prepares and packages meat, like beef, to sell to stores.</span></span> to take a <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>marginal loss<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Losing a small amount of money on each sale of beef.</span></span> on beef in order to <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>stimulate demand<span class="explanation" annotation-element>To make more people want to buy beef.</span></span>, but he must at once <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>hedge<span class="explanation" annotation-element>To protect against losing money by doing something else that will make money if the first thing loses money.</span></span> against this loss by buying cattle cheaper. He tries to fit the price he pays for cattle each day to the price he is obtaining for beef. Only by so doing can he maintain his business on present small margins. Large <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>receipts<span class="explanation" annotation-element>The amount of things, like fish or vegetables, that are received or delivered.</span></span> of fish, poultry, game, eggs, vegetables or fruit at certain seasons also affect the price the public is willing to pay for beef, and this is <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>reflected<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Shown or affected by something else.</span></span> in the price the <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>packer<span class="explanation" annotation-element>A company that prepares and packages meat, like beef, to sell to stores.</span></span> can <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>afford<span class="explanation" annotation-element>To be able to pay for something.</span></span> to pay for the live animal.</p>
  <p annotation-id="89">It is plain that the <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>packer<span class="explanation" annotation-element>A company that prepares meat for sale, like cutting and wrapping it.</span></span> cannot determine <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>retail<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Selling directly to customers in a store.</span></span> meat prices, simply because he cannot say to the <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>consumer<span class="explanation" annotation-element>The person who buys and uses something.</span></span> at the butcher’s counter, “You must buy meat and you must pay such and such a price.” Because he cannot do this he cannot <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>control<span class="explanation" annotation-element>To be in charge of something and make it do what you want.</span></span> the prices of <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>livestock<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Animals like cows and pigs that are raised on farms.</span></span>.</p>

Of scarcely less importance is the <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>packing business<span class="explanation" annotation-element>The job of getting meat ready to be sold in stores after the animals are raised on farms.</span></span>.

  <p annotation-id="93">But it is <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>profitable<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Making money; it's good because you earn something!</span></span> and <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>enlightening<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Helping you understand something better, like learning a cool new fact.</span></span> to ask, of what use would be <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>production<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Making things, like growing food on a farm.</span></span> and <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>preparation<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Getting something ready, like when you cook food.</span></span> without <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>means<span class="explanation" annotation-element>A way of doing something, like using a car to travel.</span></span> for <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>delivering<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Taking something to someone, like when the mailman brings your mail.</span></span> the food to the <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>consumer<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Someone who buys things, like you when you buy candy.</span></span>?

  <p annotation-id="94">And this, in turn, brings us to the <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>consideration<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Thinking about something carefully.</span></span> of the <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>packers<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Companies that prepare meat to be sold.</span></span>’ <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>salesmen<span class="explanation" annotation-element>People who sell things for a company.</span></span> in the hundreds of cities and towns throughout America, which as a whole make up the final <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>market<span class="explanation" annotation-element>A place where things are bought and sold.</span></span> for the <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>producer<span class="explanation" annotation-element>The farmer who raises the animals.</span></span>’s <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>livestock<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Animals like cows and pigs that are raised on farms.</span></span>.</p>
  <p annotation-id="95">With the sale of his meat animals by the <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>commission man<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Someone who sells things for you and gets paid a percentage of the money from the sale.</span></span> at the <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>primary market<span class="explanation" annotation-element>The first place where things are sold.</span></span>, the owner seems to witness the end of the <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>transaction<span class="explanation" annotation-element>A business deal, like buying or selling something.</span></span> as far as he is concerned. But does he?</p>
  <p annotation-id="96">Could the <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>commission man<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Someone who helps sell farm animals for a fee, like a helper who gets paid when the animals are sold.</span></span> sell and the <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>packer<span class="explanation" annotation-element>A company that prepares meat for sale, like a big butcher shop.</span></span> buy the <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>livestock<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Farm animals like cows, pigs, and chickens.</span></span> if it were not for another salesman and another buyer out at the <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>farthest end of the market system<span class="explanation" annotation-element>The very last place where things are bought and sold, like the grocery store where people buy meat.</span></span> <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>transacting business<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Buying and selling things, like when you buy candy at the store.</span></span> with each other in the <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>retail market<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Where regular people like you and me buy things in stores.</span></span>?</p>
  <p annotation-id="97">Again the question answers itself.

  <p annotation-id="98">There are two <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>distinct<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Different or separate.</span></span> <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>divisions<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Parts or sections.</span></span> of the <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>process<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Steps you take to do something.</span></span> of turning <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>livestock<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Farm animals like cows and pigs.</span></span> into <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>available<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Ready to be used or bought.</span></span> meat <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>supplies<span class="explanation" annotation-element>The amount of something ready to be used.</span></span>.

  <h2>Farming as a Business</h2>
  <p class="drop-cap" annotation-id="101">ALL business <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>Undertakings<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Like when you start a big project, like building a really tall tower of blocks. It's something you're trying to do.</span></span> are <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>Ventures<span class="explanation" annotation-element>When you try something new that might be a little risky, like trying a new flavor of ice cream you've never had before. You don't know if you'll like it!</span></span>. Under the best of <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>Conditions<span class="explanation" annotation-element>The way things are, like if it's sunny or rainy outside.</span></span> there are fat and <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>Lean Years<span class="explanation" annotation-element>When you don't have many toys or treats. It's a time when you don't have much.</span></span>, and the <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>Possibility<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Means something might happen, like it might rain later.</span></span> of <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>Failure<span class="explanation" annotation-element>When you try to do something but it doesn't work out the way you wanted, like if your block tower falls down.</span></span>, due to poor <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>Management<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Like when someone is in charge of making sure everyone is doing their job and things are going smoothly.</span></span>, lack of <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>Capital<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Like having money to buy things you need for your project or business.</span></span>, or <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>Adversity<span class="explanation" annotation-element>When something bad happens that makes things hard, like if it starts raining when you're trying to have a picnic.</span></span>, is always <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>Present<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Means it is here or it can happen now.</span></span>.</p>
  <p annotation-id="102">Farming is no exception. It is in <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>essence<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Essence means what something really is at its core, like the most important part of it.</span></span> a business <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>proposition<span class="explanation" annotation-element>A proposition is like an idea or a plan that someone suggests for you to think about or do.</span></span>, and should be so <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>regarded<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Regarded means to think about something in a certain way, or to consider it as something.</span></span>.</p>
  <p annotation-id="103">A knowledge of crops, of soils and tillage, of livestock breeding and feeding and other <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>purely<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Means 'only' or 'just'. Like saying 'that's purely for fun', meaning it's only for fun and nothing else.</span></span> <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>agricultural<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Relating to farming or growing crops and raising animals.</span></span> subjects <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>constitutes<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Means 'makes up' or 'is a part of'. Think of it like building blocks - each block constitutes, or is a part of, the whole building.</span></span> but one side of the farming industry. On top of this come the important matters of business <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>management<span class="explanation" annotation-element>The act of organizing and dealing with something.</span></span>—the buying of seeds, <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>fertilizers<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Special stuff added to the soil to help plants grow bigger and stronger.</span></span>, <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>feed stuffs<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Different kinds of food that animals eat, like hay or grain.</span></span>, livestock and general equipment and supplies; the <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>erecting<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Means to build or put something up, like building a house or a barn.</span></span> and <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>maintenance<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Means keeping something in good shape by fixing it when it breaks or needs care.</span></span> of buildings; the arrangements for necessary <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>credit<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Like borrowing money from a bank that you have to pay back later.</span></span>; keeping in touch with market conditions and prices; the hiring of help, and finally the establishing and <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>operation<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Means how something works or is run. Like the operation of a farm means how the farm is managed and taken care of.</span></span> of an accurate <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>cost-accounting system<span class="explanation" annotation-element>A way to keep track of how much money you spend to make or grow something, so you know if you're making a profit.</span></span>.</p>
  <p annotation-id="104">Yet when all is said and done, records indicate that farming offers more chances of success than almost any other line of business <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>endeavor<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Trying to do something new or hard.</span></span>. A <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>retail merchant<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Someone who owns a store and sells things to people.</span></span>, according to <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>statistics<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Numbers that help show what is happening or what is true.</span></span>, has from two to four chances in ten to conduct his business successfully for fifteen years; a <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>manufacturer<span class="explanation" annotation-element>A person or company that makes things in a factory.</span></span> has from two to seven chances to do the same. Farming is <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>conspicuous<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Easy to notice.</span></span> for its small <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>percentage<span class="explanation" annotation-element>How many out of 100.</span></span> of out-and-out failures. Living is practically <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>assured<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Guaranteed or for sure.</span></span>, which gives the farmer a <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>distinct<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Clear and different from others.</span></span> working <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>advantage<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Something that helps you do better than others.</span></span> to begin with. He enjoys a cash market and is not called upon to suffer bad debt losses. He is in an industry that is absolutely <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>essential<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Something that is really needed.</span></span>, which cannot be destroyed by any <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>shifting of circumstances<span class="explanation" annotation-element>When things change around you.</span></span>.</p>
  <p annotation-id="105">The greatest need is <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>doubtless<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Without question; for sure.</span></span> for <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>cost-accounting systems<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Ways to track how much money things cost so you don't spend too much.</span></span> which will serve as a guide, not only to prevent <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>unwise<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Not smart or a bad idea.</span></span> purchases, but to indicate wise <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>expenditures<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Money spent.</span></span> in <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>improvements<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Making things better.</span></span> that will bring a good <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>return on investment<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Getting more money back than you spent.</span></span>, and to show definitely the amount of profit obtained on each <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>transaction<span class="explanation" annotation-element>A business deal; when you buy or sell something.</span></span>. Next to this in <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>importance<span class="explanation" annotation-element>How much something matters.</span></span> is perhaps the need for a <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>thorough<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Complete and detailed.</span></span> understanding of <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>crop rotation<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Changing the crops you plant in a field each time, to keep the soil healthy.</span></span> and the principle of <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>diversified farming<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Growing many different types of crops or raising different animals, so if one does badly, the others can still do well.</span></span> as a means of <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>offsetting<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Balancing things out.</span></span> losses in one line with gains in another. The securing of credit to enable <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>expansion<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Growing bigger.</span></span>, and the <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>adoption<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Starting to use something.</span></span> of <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>labor-saving devices<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Machines that help people do work with less effort.</span></span> are also <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>essential<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Very important or necessary.</span></span>.</p>
  <p annotation-id="106">Profits and losses in farming must be <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>Reckoned<span class="explanation" annotation-element>To figure out or calculate something, like adding up all your money to see how much you have.</span></span>, as in all other businesses, on <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>Averages<span class="explanation" annotation-element>A number you get when you add a group of numbers together and then divide by how many numbers were in the group.

But the future offers better <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>Assurance<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Being sure about something; like knowing you'll get a good grade because you studied hard.</span></span> than ever before to the man who is a good <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>Agriculturist<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Someone who is a farmer; someone who knows a lot about growing things like plants and animals.</span></span> and at the same time a <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>Skillful<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Being really good at something because you've practiced it a lot.</span></span> <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>Business Manager<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Someone who is in charge of a business and makes sure it runs well and makes money.</span></span>.</p>

  <p annotation-id="110">At the same time the risks of the business are greater than in other lines, both on account of the <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>perishable<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Spoils or goes bad quickly, like milk left out of the fridge.</span></span> nature of the product and the violent <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>fluctuations<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Big ups and downs, like a rollercoaster.</span></span> of food prices, the causes for which cannot always be <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>foreseen<span class="explanation" annotation-element>To know ahead of time, like predicting it will rain.</span></span>.</p>
  <p annotation-id="111">The <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>comparative<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Like saying one thing is 'like' another when looking at how they are different or similar.</span></span> low prices of hogs and <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>pork products<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Things like bacon, ham, and sausage that are made from pigs.</span></span> at the end of 1919 is a case in point. The <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>packing business<span class="explanation" annotation-element>A business that prepares meat to be sold.</span></span> entered upon the year in the belief that the world <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>shortage<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Not having enough of something.</span></span> of food would <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>maintain<span class="explanation" annotation-element>To keep something the same.</span></span> pork prices at high levels for a number of years; that European demand would absorb even a larger <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>surplus<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Extra, more than what is needed.</span></span> of American hogs than the <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>pre-war period<span class="explanation" annotation-element>The time before a war happened.</span></span>. The earlier months of 1919 <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>confirmed<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Showed that something was true.</span></span> this belief. The foreign demand was very <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>brisk<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Busy and quick.</span></span>, <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>exports<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Sending goods to another country to sell.</span></span> reached <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>unprecedented<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Never happened before.</span></span> <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>volume<span class="explanation" annotation-element>How much of something there is.</span></span> and prices were <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>maintain<span class="explanation" annotation-element>To keep something the same.</span></span>ed.</p>
  <p annotation-id="112">Then came the <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>unlooked-for event<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Something that happened that no one expected.</span></span>. <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>Foreign exchange rates<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Imagine each country has its own money, like dollars or euros. The 'exchange rate' is how much of one country's money you need to buy another country's money. 'Foreign' just means from another country. So, 'foreign exchange rates' tell you how much it costs to buy money from other countries.</span></span> fell to so low a point that <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>Europeans<span class="explanation" annotation-element>People who live in Europe, which is a continent made up of many countries like France, Germany, and Spain.</span></span> could no longer <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>afford<span class="explanation" annotation-element>To have enough money to buy something.</span></span> to buy American meats. The <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>Packers<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Companies that prepare meat for people to buy, like at the grocery store.</span></span> <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>extended credit<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Letting someone buy something now and pay for it later.</span></span> for a time, but the <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>limit of safety<span class="explanation" annotation-element>The point where it becomes too risky to do something.</span></span> was soon reached, and when the year closed very little American pork was being <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>exported<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Sending goods, like pork, to another country to sell.</span></span> and no new <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>contracts<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Agreements to buy or sell something.</span></span> were being made.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>
  <p annotation-id="113">The result was great loss to both <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>producers<span class="explanation" annotation-element>The farmers who raise the pigs.</span></span> and <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>packers<span class="explanation" annotation-element>The companies that prepare the meat to be sold.</span></span>. Armour and Company alone packed <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>millions<span class="explanation" annotation-element>A whole lot! More than you can easily count.</span></span> of <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>pounds<span class="explanation" annotation-element>A way to measure how heavy something is.</span></span> of <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>pork<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Meat from pigs.</span></span> during the <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>period<span class="explanation" annotation-element>A length of time.</span></span> of high prices, much of which was still in the course of <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>curing<span class="explanation" annotation-element>A way to keep meat from spoiling by using salt and other things.</span></span> when the <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>slump<span class="explanation" annotation-element>When the price of something drops quickly.</span></span> in the <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>market<span class="explanation" annotation-element>A place where people buy and sell things.</span></span> came.</p>
  <p annotation-id="114">But the conditions that caused this decline and loss are <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>exceptional<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Very unusual, not something that happens often.</span></span> and only <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>temporary<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Doesn't last for a very long time; it will change soon.</span></span>. The great foreign need for American meats still exists—the greatest need in the world’s history. The ability of Europe to buy will be <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>restored<span class="explanation" annotation-element>To bring something back to the way it was before; to fix it up.</span></span> with the full restoration of peace and the <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>arrangement<span class="explanation" annotation-element>A plan or agreement about how something will work.</span></span> of <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>international<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Between different countries.</span></span> <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>credits<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Like a loan; giving someone money now that they promise to pay back later.</span></span>. The result will be a return of profits and <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>prosperity<span class="explanation" annotation-element>When people are doing well and have lots of money and good things.</span></span> to both <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>producers<span class="explanation" annotation-element>The people who make or grow things, like farmers who raise pigs.</span></span> and <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>packers<span class="explanation" annotation-element>The people who prepare meat to be sold in stores.</span></span> of pork.</p>
  <p annotation-id="115">The facts to keep in mind are these:</p>
  <p annotation-id="116">First, there must finally be a <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>realignment<span class="explanation" annotation-element>To line something up again. In this case, it means prices need to change and find a new, better spot.</span></span> of prices on all <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>livestock<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Animals like cows, pigs, and chickens that are raised on a farm.</span></span> and meats, to levels below the <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>prevailing<span class="explanation" annotation-element>The prices that are most common or popular right now.</span></span> high war prices. A fair balance must be struck between the interests of the <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>consumer<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Someone who buys and eats the meat.</span></span> and those of the <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>producer<span class="explanation" annotation-element>A farmer who raises the animals (livestock).</span></span>. Prices for meat must be sufficiently attractive to <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>consumer<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Someone who buys and eats the meat.</span></span>s to <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>insure<span class="explanation" annotation-element>To make sure something happens.</span></span> an <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>adequate<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Enough, or just the right amount.</span></span> <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>volume<span class="explanation" annotation-element>How much of something there is. Like a lot of meat being sold.</span></span> of sales; on the other hand prices for <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>livestock<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Animals like cows, pigs, and chickens that are raised on a farm.</span></span> must be sufficiently high to encourage production. Only on this basis can the industry <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>thrive<span class="explanation" annotation-element>To grow strong and healthy, like a plant or a business doing really well.</span></span>.</p>
  <p annotation-id="117">Second, the <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>utmost<span class="explanation" annotation-element>The greatest or highest degree; like saying 'the most' important.</span></span> <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>care<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Paying close attention and being careful.</span></span> must be taken in <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>breeding<span class="explanation" annotation-element>When animals have babies and you choose which ones to be parents so the babies will be good for something like making meat or milk.</span></span> and buying of feeding <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>stock<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Animals that are raised on a farm, like cows or pigs.</span></span> and the most <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>exacting<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Very careful and precise; like making sure everything is just right.</span></span> <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>economy<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Being careful with money and resources, not wasting anything.</span></span> <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>practiced<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Doing something regularly to get better at it; like practicing piano.</span></span> in feeding <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>methods<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Ways of doing something; like different ways to cook an egg.</span></span>.</p>
  <p annotation-id="118">Third, the <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>producer<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Someone who grows or raises animals, like cows or pigs, to sell.</span></span> must realize that the <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>packer<span class="explanation" annotation-element>A company that takes the animals from the farmer and prepares the meat for people to buy in stores.</span></span> is his <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>natural ally<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Like being on the same team and helping each other out.</span></span> in <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>maintaining<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Keeping something going and in good shape.</span></span> the <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>prosperity<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Being successful and having enough money.</span></span> of the two <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>inseparable<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Cannot be separated; always connected.</span></span> <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>branches<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Different parts of the same bigger thing, like branches on a tree.</span></span> of the <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>livestock industry<span class="explanation" annotation-element>All the businesses involved in raising animals like cows, pigs, and chickens for food.</span></span>—<span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>production<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Making or growing something, like raising animals on a farm.</span></span> and <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>packing<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Preparing the meat from the animals to be sold in stores.</span></span>.</p>
  <p annotation-id="119">It is a <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>reassuring<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Makes you feel better and more confident.</span></span> sign that <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>producers<span class="explanation" annotation-element>People who raise animals like cows and pigs to sell.</span></span> and <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>packers<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Companies that prepare meat to be sold in stores.</span></span> are already getting together on a <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>platform<span class="explanation" annotation-element>A shared goal or idea that people agree on.</span></span> of better understanding of their <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>mutual<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Something that both groups share or have in common.</span></span> <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>interests<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Things that are important to them and that they care about.</span></span>, both for <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>protection<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Keeping safe from harm or problems.</span></span> against <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>disturbing<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Causing worry or problems.</span></span> <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>agitation<span class="explanation" annotation-element>People trying to stir up trouble or cause problems by complaining.</span></span> and <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>legislation<span class="explanation" annotation-element>New laws or rules.</span></span> and for the <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>correction<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Fixing something that is wrong.</span></span> of whatever <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>inequalities<span class="explanation" annotation-element>When things are not fair or equal for everyone.</span></span> or <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>abuses<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Treating someone badly or unfairly.</span></span> may exist in the <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>shipping<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Moving animals from one place to another, like on a truck or train.</span></span> and <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>marketing<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Selling or advertising the animals to people who want to buy them.</span></span> of <span class="annotation-group" annotation-element>livestock<span class="explanation" annotation-element>Animals like cows, pigs, and chickens that are raised on farms.</span></span>.</p>

    Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
   </div>
   <div>
    Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.
   </div>
   <div>
    Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

    Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
   </div>
   <div>
    Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.
   </div>
   <div>
    The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
   </div>
   <div>
    While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.
   </div>
   <div>
    International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
   </div>
   <div>
    Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

    Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
   </div>
   <div>
    Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
   </div>
   <div>
    Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
