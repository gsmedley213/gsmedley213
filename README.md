## üìö Project Gutenberg Annotation Pipeline

I‚Äôve developed a three-stage pipeline that uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate tooltip-like annotations for public domain books from Project Gutenberg.

---

### üîó The Pipeline at a Glance

1. **Content Extraction**  
   [`content-extractor`](https://github.com/gsmedley213/content-extractor)  
   Extracts content from a Project Gutenberg HTML eBook and saves a new HTML file with elements marked to associate them with extracted content.
   
3. **LLM Annotation**  
   [`llm-annotate`](https://github.com/gsmedley213/llm-annotate)  
   Uses an LLM (Google Gemini) to generate notes on book content, outputting to JSON.

4. **HTML Annotation Synthesis**  
   [`html-annotate`](https://github.com/gsmedley213/html-annotate)  
   Combines the marked HTML and the generated notes to produce a new file with notes presented like tooltips.

## Example Output

A live example of the finished product generated by this project is available here:  
[View Example Output on GitHub Pages](https://gsmedley213.github.io/gsmedley213/)

### About the Example

The example shows an HTML file where tooltip-style notes have been created for words and phrases that a 5th grader might not understand. 

Hover over highlighted text to see the notes.

## Design Rationale

This project currently uses a file-based approach for communication between services. This method was chosen for simplicity and ease of local development and testing. Having direct access to the input and output files makes it easier to see what is happening. You can also diff files from different runs, or from different stages of the same run, to check that changes have the desired effects.

## Future Plans

I plan to evolve this project by:
- Migrating the inter-service communication to cloud-based messaging and storage solutions (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob, or Pub/Sub).
- Deploying each service as a containerized microservice.
- Adding a fourth webservice that allows users to directly start the pipeline by providing a Project Gutenberg link, eliminating the need to manually download and extract files.

The file-based approach will remain supported for local development, testing, and learning purposes.

Additional future plans for the specific services are outlined in their README files.
